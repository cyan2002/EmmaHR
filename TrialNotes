Trial 1 - REVISIT
Input 0 - Early BP
Input 1 - Bad Shape
Input 3 - double BP
Input 4 - Bad Shape

Trial 2 - REVISIT
Input 0 - Bad Shape
Input 1 - Bad Shape
Input 5 - Bad Shape

Trial 3 - REVISIT
Input 3 - feedback (trash)
Input 5 - Add more points (noise)

Trial 4 - Starting to notice weird pattern of FLT. I had previously thought adult FLTs were at 37 or so, but most individuals FLT I have seen lie around 40 degrees Celcius (REVISIT)
Input 2 - Bad Shape

Trial 5 (GOOD)
Input 3 - maybe add more points (kinda messy)

Trial 6
Input 1 - Feedback near the end, also bad shape
Input 3 - bad shape
Input 4 - bad shape
Input 5 - Bad shape

Trial 7 - A lot of BPs at 35 here, while nothing wrong it seems sus intuition wise... Keep for now
Input 0 - slight double BP
Input 2 - Bad Shape

Trial 8 
Input 1 - bad shape
Input 5 - add more points - sketchy shape

Trial 9 - ALL GOOD
Input 0 - Small double abt? perhaps double check (nah all good)

Trial 10
Input 3 - Bad shape, potential throw out (constant decrease)

Trial 11
Input 2 - double breaking point...? check (seems okay)

Trial 12
Input 0 - shape doesn't look good
Input 3 - 4 points make shape look weird
Input 4 - Late break point?
Input 5 - weird shape

Trial 13
Input 1 - Trash input (potential revisit?), late BP too

Trial 14 - There seems to be a lot of feedback (double breaking point) in trial 14
Input 3 - Messy
Inut 5 - lot's of feedback, trash or redo

Trial 15 - Overall ok graphs, but input 1 and 2 have kinda early break points (may look into later)

Trial 16
Input 1 - double break point (double check)
Input 2 - bad shape
Input 3 - double break point
Input 4 - constant decrease (perhaps throw out)

----------------------REDO----------------------------

Trial 1
Input 3 - Still see double breaking point...?

Trial 2
Input 5 - throw out, poor shape

Trial 3
Input 3 - Throw out (clear feedback)

Trial 4 
Input 2 - Double breaking point (past 1st ABT it seems... unsure with what to do)

Trial 5
Good

Trial 6
Input 1 - Throw out (feedback)
Input 3 - still a bit noisy, but semi good shape

Trial 7
Input 0 - Still finding odd results, original shape isn't bad just 3 off points. Perhaps re analyze. 

Trial 8
Good

Trial 9
Good

Trial 10
Good

Trial 11
Good

Trial 12
-Input 0, 4 and 5 bad readings (perhaps throw out), while Input 5 has a reading, I got 2 different results so maybe retry INPUT 5 ONLY
-Input 4 has feedback

Trial 13
Good

Trial 14
