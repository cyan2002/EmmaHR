Trial 1 - REVISIT
Input 0 - Early BP
Input 1 - Bad Shape
Input 3 - double BP
Input 4 - Bad Shape

Trial 2 - REVISIT
Input 0 - Bad Shape
Input 1 - Bad Shape
Input 5 - Bad Shape

Trial 3 - REVISIT
Input 3 - feedback (trash)
Input 5 - Add more points (noise)

Trial 4 - Starting to notice weird pattern of FLT. I had previously thought adult FLTs were at 37 or so, but most individuals FLT I have seen lie around 40 degrees Celcius (REVISIT)
Input 2 - Bad Shape

Trial 5 (GOOD)
Input 3 - maybe add more points (kinda messy)

Trial 6
Input 1 - Feedback near the end, also bad shape
Input 3 - bad shape
Input 4 - bad shape
Input 5 - Bad shapel

Input 4 Trial 8 - unsure of FLT

Input 0, Trial 9 - Small double abt? perhaps double check

Trial 10
Input 2 - a lot of feedback near the end, difficult to tell what is a signal vs not
Input 3 - early breaking point, perhaps look again perhaps throw out

Trial 11
Input 2 - double breaking point...? check

Trial 12
Input 0 - shape doesn't look good
Input 3 - 4 points make shape look weird
Input 4 - Late break point?
Input 5 - weird shape

Trial 13
Input 1 - Trash input (potential revisit?)

Trial 14 - There seems to be a lot of feedback (double breaking point) in trial 14
Input 0 - very low breaking point (but shape looks good)
Input 3 - Messy
Inut 5 - lot's of feedback, trash or redo

Trial 15 - Overall ok graphs, but input 1 and 2 have kinda early break points (may look into later)

Trial 16
Input 1 - double break point (double check)
Input 2 - bad shape
Input 3 - double break point
Input 4 - constant decrease (perhaps throw out)

----------------------REDO----------------------------

Trial 1
Input 3 - Still see double breaking point...?

Trial 2
Input 5 - throw out, poor shape
