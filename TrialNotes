Trial 1 - Good

Trial 2 - May need to revisit

Trial 3 Input 3 - feedback

Trial 4 - Starting to notice weird pattern of FLT. I had previously thought adult FLTs were at 37 or so, but most individuals FLT I have seen lie around 40 degrees Celcius

Input 1 Trial 6 - Feedback near the end

Input 4 Trial 8 - unsure of FLT

Input 0, Trial 9 - Small double abt? perhaps double check

Input 2, Trial 10 - a lot of feedback near the end, difficult to tell what is a signal vs not
Input 3, Trial 10 - early breaking point, perhaps look again perhaps throw out

Input 2, Trial 11 - double breaking point...? check

Input 0, Trial 12 - shape doesn't look good
Input 3, Trial 12 - 4 points make shape look weird
Input 4, Trial 12 - Late break point?
Input 5, Trial 12 - weird shape
Maybe re do Trial 12

Trash input 1, Trial 13 (potential revisit?)
Rest of Trial 13 is good

Trial 14 - There seems to be a lot of feedback (double breaking point) in trial 14
Input 0 - very low breaking point (but shape looks good)
Input 3 - Messy
Inut 5 - lot's of feedback, trash or redo

Trial 15 - Overall ok graphs, but input 1 and 2 have kinda early break points (may look into later)

Trial 16
Input 1 - double break point (double check)
Input 2 - bad shape
Input 3 - double break point
Input 4 - constant decrease (perhaps throw out)
