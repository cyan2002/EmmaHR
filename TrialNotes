Trial 1 - Good
Trial 2 - May need to revisit
Trial 3 Input 3 - feedback
Trial 4 - Starting to notice weird pattern of FLT. I had previously thought adult FLTs were at 37 or so, but most individuals FLT I have seen lie around 40 degrees Celcius
Input 1 Trial 6 - Feedback near the end
Input 4 Trial 8 - unsure of FLT
